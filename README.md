# Desword - A markdown worldbuilder's assistant

![example branch parameter](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Goal

Desword aims to provide writers with an easy method of keeping track of the elements of their world that they have fleshed out, and those that they haven't.  This is achieved by parsing links and keeping track of links that don't currently link to a page. This is then presented as a list of "TODO" items. Additionally, links to a page are displayed in list form on each page, along with contents and category top level pages.
